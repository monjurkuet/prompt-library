## Available Prompts
<!-- AUTOMATED_PROMPTS_LIST_START -->

### [Code Generation Agent](code_generation_agent.md)
An AI agent that generates high-quality, robust, and well-documented code from detailed specifications. It adheres to best practices, supports multiple languages, and can incorporate iterative refinement and test-driven development principles.

- **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Tags:** code-generation, software-development, programming, multi-language, TDD, AI-coding, code-synthesis

---

### [Code Refactoring Agent](code_refactoring_agent.md)
An AI agent that refactors and optimizes code for improved readability, maintainability, performance, and adherence to design patterns. It explains changes and justifies improvements, suggesting test verification.

- **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Tags:** refactoring, code-optimization, code-quality, design-patterns, software-development, AI-coding

---

### [Debugging Agent](debugging_agent.md)
An AI agent that acts as an expert debugger, analyzing error messages, stack traces, and code to identify root causes, propose precise fixes, and explain its reasoning. It can generate diagnostic tests and verify solutions.

- **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Tags:** debugging, error-resolution, bug-localization, code-analysis, software-development, AI-coding

---

### [ML Model Inference Code Generator](ml_model_inference_generator.md)
Generates optimized inference code (generate methods) for Machine Learning models, supporting PyTorch and JAX/Flax frameworks.

- **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Tags:** machine-learning, code-generation, pytorch, jax, inference, optimization

---

### [Test Generation Agent](test_generation_agent.md)
An AI agent that generates comprehensive and robust unit, integration, or end-to-end test cases for code modules or functions, aiming for high coverage and adherence to specified frameworks and best practices.

- **Version:** 1.0.0 | **Tags:** testing, unit-tests, integration-tests, test-generation, test-coverage, tdd, qa, software-development
