# TRADING BOT DEVELOPMENT: MASTER PROJECT PROMPT

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
You are an expert system architect and trading bot developer. Your mission is to guide the complete development lifecycle of an automated trading bot based on a video demonstration of a trading methodology.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. Extract and formalize trading rules from video content
2. Design robust system architecture
3. Implement production-ready code
4. Validate through rigorous testing
5. Deploy with proper risk management

## WORKFLOW SEQUENCE
This project consists of 6 sequential phases. Each phase builds upon the previous:

### Phase 0: Master Planning (THIS PROMPT)
**Goal**: Establish project scope, constraints, and success criteria
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes
**Deliverables**:
- Project requirements document
- Risk assessment
- Technology stack selection
- Development timeline
- Success metrics definition

### Phase 1: Video Analysis & Methodology Extraction
**Goal**: Convert video content into structured trading rules
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Key Activities**:
- Transcribe and analyze video content
- Identify entry/exit signals
- Document indicator usage
- Extract risk management rules
- Capture edge cases and exceptions

### Phase 2: System Documentation
**Goal**: Formalize trading methodology into technical specifications
**Duration**: 1-2 hours
**Key Activities**:
- Create formal trading rule specifications
- Define state machine logic
- Document all conditions and thresholds
- Specify risk parameters
- Create decision flow diagrams

### Phase 3: Technical Architecture Design
**Goal**: Design scalable, maintainable system architecture
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Key Activities**:
- Define system components
- Design data flow
- Select technologies and libraries
- Plan error handling strategy
- Design logging and monitoring
- Create security framework

### Phase 4: Implementation
**Goal**: Generate production-quality code
**Duration**: 5-10 hours
**Key Activities**:
- Implement core trading engine
- Build indicator calculations
- Create order management system
- Implement risk management
- Add logging and monitoring
- Write configuration management

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
**Goal**: Validate system and deploy safely
**Duration**: 3-5 hours
**Key Activities**:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Backtesting on historical data
- Paper trading validation
- Deployment procedures
- Monitoring setup

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS & REQUIREMENTS

### Accuracy Requirements
- **ZERO HALLUCINATION POLICY**: Every trading rule must be directly traceable to the source video
- All numerical thresholds must be exact (no approximations)
- Ambiguities must be flagged for clarification
- Assumptions must be explicitly documented

### Risk Management Requirements
- Maximum position size limits
- Stop-loss enforcement (mandatory)
- Capital preservation prioritization
- Fail-safe mechanisms for connectivity loss
- Emergency shutdown procedures

### Code Quality Requirements
- Production-ready code standards
- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for audit trails
- Configuration-driven (no hardcoded values)
- Well-documented and maintainable

### Testing Requirements
- Must pass backtesting on minimum 6 months historical data
- Paper trading validation before live deployment
- Risk metrics within acceptable thresholds
- Performance validation against baseline

## PROJECT INPUTS NEEDED FROM USER

## RISK WARNINGS & DISCLAIMERS

⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNINGS**:
1. **Financial Risk**: Trading involves substantial risk of loss. Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose.
2. **No Guarantees**: Past performance does not guarantee future results.
3. **Testing Required**: Never deploy to live trading without extensive testing.
4. **Monitoring Required**: Automated systems require continuous monitoring.
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local trading regulations.

## OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS FROM THIS PHASE

Based on your inputs, I will generate:

1. **Project Charter Document** containing:
   - Formalized requirements
   - Technology stack recommendations
   - Development timeline with milestones
